# What is .NET Foundation Website ?
The .NET Foundation is an organization incorporated on March 31, 2014, by Microsoft to improve open-source software development and collaboration around 
the .NET Framework.
It was launched at the annual Build 2014 conference held by Microsoft.
The foundation is license-agnostic, and projects that come to the foundation are free to choose any open-source license,
defined by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). The foundation uses GitHub to host the open-source projects it manages.

Anyone who has contributed to .NET Foundation projects can apply to be a .NET Foundation member. 
Members can vote in elections for the board of the directors and will preserve the health of the organization.
